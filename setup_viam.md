# Setup Viam

Before we can setup our sensors we will need to configure viam. 
This includes creating an account on [app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com), 
installing the viam rdk on our robot, then we can configure our 
custom sensors.

## Sign up and create our first robot

1. access [app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com) and create an account using our email or a gmail account
